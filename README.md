# DTMF_decoder
## Matlab DTMF decoder
### First you need to read the .wav file with loadWav.m, change the file name to match yours, i uploaded some examples for you to test it.
Once you have 'y' variable loaded in your MatLab workspace you just need to run the function stored in DTMF_decoder.m

```
DTMF_decoder(y) 
```
